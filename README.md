# Optimizing-TF2
Resources, tips, and recommendations to allow you to enjoy smooth & high refresh rates playing TF2

# - Launch Options
  Steam allows for some automated commands to effect the startup of games. Some of these commands disable features that are useless to the typical user, so disabling these     features allows for less resource consumption when playing, with absoluteley no difference in gameplay. Of course, if you plan on using any of these features, you can just   not disable said feature in the launch options.

##  -  Navigating to TF2's launch options
      1. Navigate to Library
      2. Right-click on TF2
      3. Go to Properties > General, and scroll down to see A text box labeled 'Launch Options'

##  - Launch options
      - -nosteamcontroller
      > Disables compatibility with steam deck.
      - -nojoy
      > Disables controller compatibility.
      - -nohltv
      > Disables broadcasting.
      - -vrdisable
      > Disables compatibility with VR headsets.
      - -fps_max #
      > '#' being the amount of fps to cap. Capping your fps increases stability and keeps it more consistent. I suggest your monitor's refresh rate, but some would argue set it higher due to hit register advantages.
      - -fullscreen
      > Usually default. If game isn't fullscreen, your desktop environment must display other things such as your wallpaper, shortcuts, taskbar, etc., using minute amounts of ram, but every last bit counts.
      - -noquicktime
      > Disables rendering of replays
      - -softparticlesdefaultoff
      > 
      - -particles 1
      > 
      - -precachefontchars
      > 
      - -noff
      > Disables controller vibration
      - -nogamepadui
      > Self explanatory, disables UI for gamepad compatibility such as the steam deck.
     
      (options past this point do not increase performance but improve user experience)
    
      - -noforcemaccel
      > Disables mouse acceleration
      - -novid
      > Skips the Valve intro when booting TF2
